# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Only the latest published version of `mailrify` receives security updates. We recommend upgrading to the newest release before reporting issues.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please email security@mailrify.com with the following details:

- A clear description of the vulnerability and its impact
- Steps to reproduce the issue (proof-of-concept code is appreciated)
- Any relevant environment details (Node.js version, SDK version)

We aim to acknowledge reports within 48 hours. Once triaged, we will work with you on mitigation, coordinated disclosure timelines, and credit (if desired).

Do not open public GitHub issues for security concernsâ€”this helps protect the Mailrify community while a fix is prepared.
